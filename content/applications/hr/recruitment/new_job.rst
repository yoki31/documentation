=============
Job positions
=============

In the default :menuselection:`Recruitment` dashboard view, all job positions are shown, regardless
of status. Current published positions with active applicants are shown, as well as job positions
that have been created but have not yet been published.

Each job position is shown in an individual kanban card. If the job position is active and
candidates can apply, then a :guilabel:`Published` banner will appear in the top-right corner of the
card.

View submitted applications by clicking the :guilabel:`# Applications` button, with `#` being the
number of applications received. If a position is not published, a :guilabel:`Start Recruitment`
button will appear instead.

Create a new job position
=========================

There are two ways a job position can be created: from the main :guilabel:`Recruitment` dashboard,
or from the :guilabel:`Configuration` menu.

To create a job position from the :guilabel:`Configuration` menu, go to :menuselection:`Recruitment
app --> Configuration --> Job Positions`. The job positions in this view are displayed in a list.

Create a new job position from the :guilabel:`Job Positions` dashboard by clicking the
:guilabel:`Create` button in the top-left corner.

Then, a :guilabel:`Create a Job Position` pop-up window will appear. From here, enter the name of
the position (such as `Sales Manager`, `Mechanical Engineer`, etc.). When complete, click the
:guilabel:`Create` button to save the entry, or the :guilabel:`Discard` button to delete it.

Once the job position has been created, it will appear as a card in the kanban view on the main
:guilabel:`Recruitment`` dashboard, as well as in the list view on the :guilabel:`Configuration`
dashboard.

Edit a new job position
-----------------------

Once the job position is created, it's time to enter the details for the position. Click on the
:guilabel:`‚ãÆ (three dots)` icon in the upper-right corner of the relevant card to reveal several
options, and then click :guilabel:`Edit` to edit the details.

Enter the job description in the :guilabel:`Job Description` tab. This information is what is
visible to potential employees when searching for available jobs.

Answers
*******

If :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer`, :guilabel:`Multiple choice: multiple answers
allowed`, :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box`, or :guilabel:`Matrix` is selected for the
:guilabel:`Question Type`, an :guilabel:`Answers` tab appears beneath the question. If another
:guilabel:`Question Type` is selected, the :guilabel:`Answers` tab remains hidden from view.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Multiple choice

      For both the :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer` and :guilabel:`Multiple choice:
      multiple answers allowed` question types, the answers are populated in the same way.

      First, in the :guilabel:`Answers` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a line`. A line appears, and an
      answer can be entered. After typing in the answer, click off the line, or press enter to lock
      in the new answer on the form and have another answer line appear.

      If desired, an image can be attached to the answer. Click on a line to select it, and an
      :guilabel:`Upload your file` button appears on the right side. Click the :guilabel:`Upload
      your file` button and a file explorer window appears. Navigate to the photo file, select it,
      then click :guilabel:`Open` to select it.

      Repeat this for all the answers to be added for the multiple choice question. The answers can
      be rearranged in any order. To move an answer, click on the :guilabel:`‚ÜïÔ∏è (Up-down arrows)` on
      the far left of each answer line, and drag the answer to the desired position. The order the
      answers appear in the form is the order the answers will appear online.

      To delete a line, click on the :guilabel:`üóëÔ∏è (trash can)` icon on the far right side of the
      answer line.

      .. image:: new_job/multi-answers.png
         :align: center
         :alt: Answers to a multiple choice question, where each line has a different answer listed.

   .. tab:: Single Line Text Box

      If the :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box` is selected for the :guilabel:`Question Type`, only
      two checkboxes appear in the :guilabel:`Answers` tab:

      - :guilabel:`Input must be an email`: Activate this option if the answer must be in the format
        of an email address.

        - :guilabel:`Save as user email?`: This option appears if :guilabel:`Input must be an email`
          is selected. This saves the email entered on the form as the user's email, and will be
          used anytime Odoo contacts the user via email.

      - :guilabel:`Save as user nickname?`: Activate this option to populate the answer as the
        user's nickname. This is stored and used anywhere Odoo uses a nickname.

   .. tab:: Matrix

      Sometimes, a question is asked that does not fit a standard answer format, and is best suited
      for a matrix. For example, asking an applicant what is their availability to work compared to
      the various shifts is a perfect question for a matrix format. In this example, an applicant
      can click on all the shifts they are available to work.

      For a :guilabel:`Matrix` :guilabel:`Question Type`, there are two sets of data that need to be
      input. The rows and columns must both be configured. The columns are represented by the
      :guilabel:`Choices` section, while the rows are configured in the :guilabel:`Rows` section.

      The method for populating both sections is the same. In the :guilabel:`Answers` tab, click
      :guilabel:`Add a line` in either the :guilabel:`Choices` or :guilabel:`Row` section.  A line
      appears, and an answer can be entered. After typing in the answer, click off the line, or
      press enter to lock in the new answer on the form and have another answer line appear. Repeat
      this for all answers for both the :guilabel:`Choices` and :guilabel:`Rows` sections.

      .. figure:: new_job/matrix.png
         :align: center

         This is an example matrix that asks an applicant what shifts they are available to work on
         Saturdays and Sundays, either morning, afternoon, or evening.

Description
***********

Enter any information that may be helpful to an applicant. This description will appear for this
specific question only, and therefore should be question-specific and not generalized.

Options
*******

To view the options that are available to set for a question, click on the :guilabel:`Options` tab.
The :guilabel:`Layout`, :guilabel:`Constraints`, and :guilabel:`Live Sessions` sections are
universal for all :guilabel:`Question Types`, while the :guilabel:`Answers` tab is specific to the
:guilabel:`Question Type` selected, and changes based on the selection.

Answers
^^^^^^^

- :guilabel:`Multiple choice: only one answer` and :guilabel:`Multiple choice: multiple answers
  allowed`: The :guilabel:`Answers` section is blank, with no choices needed to be made.
- :guilabel:`Multiple Lines Text Box`: A :guilabel:`Placeholder` field appears. Enter any text that
  should appear with the question to help clarify how the applicant should answer.
- :guilabel:`Single Line Text Box`, :guilabel:`Numerical Value`, :guilabel:`Date`, and
  :guilabel:`Datetime`: A :guilabel:`Validate entry` option appears. Activate this option if what
  the applicant enters must be verified as adhering to the parameters set in this section. When
  activated, several other options appear. Enter the :guilabel:`Minimum` and :guilabel:`Maximum`
  values in the corresponding fields. Depending on the :guilabel:`Question Type` selected, these
  fields may reference characters, numbers, or dates. Next, enter the text that appears when the
  answer given does not fit within the designated minimum and maximum parameters. Last, enter any
  text in the :guilabel:`Placeholder` field to provide any additional information or directions to
  assist the applicant.
- :guilabel:`Matrix`: The first option that appears is :guilabel:`Matrix Type`. Select either
  :guilabel:`One choice per row` or :guilabel:`Multiple choices per row` using the drop-down menu.

Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^

If the question is required to be answered by the applicant, activate the box next to
:guilabel:`Mandatory Answer`. An :guilabel:`Error message` field appears, with some example text in
gray (:guilabel:`This question requires an answer`). Enter the message that should appear if the
applicant attempts to move on to the next question without answering this required one. The text
should explain that the question must be answered.

Layout
^^^^^^

If the question should only appear if a previous question is answered in a specific way, activate
the :guilabel:`Conditional Display` option. A new :guilabel:`Triggering Question` field appears.
Using the drop-down menu, select the previous question this new question is linked to. Once a
previous question is selected, a :guilabel:`Triggering Answer` field appears. Select the answer that
must be selected in order for the new question to appear.

The next option is :guilabel:`Show Comments Field`. Activate the option if there should be a comment
displayed to the applicant. If activated, a :guilabel:`Comment Message` field appears. Enter the
text to appear in the :guilabel:`Comment Message` field.

.. example::
   To further illustrate a triggering question, the following is an example that is applicable to
   recruitment. The question, `Do you have management experience?` is already added. A new question
   is then added, `How many years of experience?`. This question should *only* appear if the
   applicant selected `Yes` to the question `Do you have management experience?`.

   To properly configure this example, activate the :guilabel:`Conditional Display` option. Then,
   select `Do you have management experience?` as the :guilabel:`Triggering Question`. Then, select
   :guilabel:`Yes` for the triggering answer.
