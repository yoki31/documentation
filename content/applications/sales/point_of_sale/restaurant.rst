Managing a restaurant or a bar comes with specific needs. The Point of Sale application provides

Once the POS is set to be used in a restaurant or a bar, you can:

- :doc:`organize your floors and tables to reflect your interior <restaurant/floors_tables>`;
- :ref:`take orders <floors_tables/orders>`;
- :doc:`communicate with the kitchen or the bar through the POS <restaurant/kitchen_printing>`;
- :doc:`print bills in advance and split them <restaurant/bill_printing>`;
- :doc:`collect tips <restaurant/tips>`; and
- :doc:`set different taxes for takeaway food <pricing/fiscal_position>`.
