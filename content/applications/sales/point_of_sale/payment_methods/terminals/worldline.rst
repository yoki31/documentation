Worldline
=========

Connecting a payment terminal allows you to offer a fluid payment flow to your customers and ease
the work of your cashiers.

.. important::
   - Worldline payment terminals require an :doc:`IoT Box </applications/general/iot>`.
   - Worldline is currently only available in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
   - Odoo is compatible with Worldline terminals that use the CTEP protocol (e.g., the Yomani XR and
     Yoximo terminals). If you have any doubts, contact your payment provider to ensure your
     terminal's compatibility.

Configuration
=============

Connect an IoT Box
------------------

Connecting a Worldline Payment Terminal to Odoo is a feature that requires an IoT Box. For more
information on how to connect one to your database, please refer to the
:doc:`IoT documentation </applications/general/iot/config/connect>`.

Configure the protocol
----------------------

From your terminal, click on :menuselection:`"." --> 3 --> stop --> 3 --> 0 --> 9`. Enter the
technician password **"1235789"** and click on :menuselection:`OK --> 4 --> 2`. Then, click on
:menuselection:`Change --> CTEP (as Protocole ECR) --> OK`. Click on **OK** thrice on the subsequent
screens (*CTEP ticket ECR*, *ECR ticket width*, and *Character set*). Finally, press **Stop** three
times; the terminal automatically restarts.

Set the IP address
------------------

From your terminal, click on :menuselection:`"." --> 3 --> stop --> 3 --> 0 --> 9`. Enter the
technician password **"1235789"** and click on :menuselection:`OK --> 4 --> 9`. Then, click on
:menuselection:`Change --> TCP/IP` (*TCP physical configuration* screen) :menuselection:`--> OK -->
OK` (*TCP Configuration client* screen).

Finally, set up the hostname and port number.

Hostname
~~~~~~~~

| To set up the hostname, enter your IoT box's IP address' sequence numbers and press **OK** at each
  "." until you reach the colon symbol.
| Then, press **OK** twice.

.. example::
   | Here's an IP address sequence: `10.30.19.4:8069`.
   | On the *Hostname screen*, type :menuselection:`10 --> OK --> 30 --> OK --> 19 --> OK --> 4
     --> OK --> OK`.

.. note::
   Your IoT box's IP address is available in your IoT Box application's database.

Port number
~~~~~~~~~~~

On the *Port number* screen, enter **9001** (or **9050** for Windows) and click on
:menuselection:`OK` (*ECR protocol SSL no*) :menuselection:`--> OK`. Click on **Stop** three times;
the terminal automatically restarts.

Configure the payment method
----------------------------

Enable the payment terminal :ref:`in the application settings <configuration/settings>` and
:doc:`create the related payment method <../../payment_methods>`. Set the journal type as
:guilabel:`Bank` and select :guilabel:`Worldline` in the :guilabel:`Use a Payment Terminal` field.
Then, select your terminal device in the :guilabel:`Payment Terminal Device` field.

Once the payment method is created, you can select it in your POS settings. To do so, go to the
:ref:`POS' settings <configuration/settings>`, click :guilabel:`Edit`, and add the payment method
under the :guilabel:`Payments` section.

.. tip::
   - Technician password: `1235789`
   - To reach Wordline's technical assistance, call `02 727 61 11` and choose "merchant". Your call
     is automatically transferred to the desired service.
   - Configure the cashier terminal if you have both a customer and a cashier terminal.
   - To avoid blocking the terminal, check the initial configuration beforehand.
   - Set a fixed IP to your IoT Boxâ€™s router to prevent losing the connexion.

Pay with a payment terminal
===========================

When processing a payment, select *Worldline* as payment method. Check the amount and click on
*Send*. Once the payment is successful, the status changes to *Payment Successful*.

Once your payment is processed, the type of card used and the transaction ID appear on the payment
record.

.. note::
   * In case of connexion issues between Odoo and the payment terminal, force the payment by
     clicking on *Force Done*, which allows you to validate the order. This option is only available
     after receiving an error message informing you that the connection failed.
   * To cancel the payment request, click on **cancel**.
