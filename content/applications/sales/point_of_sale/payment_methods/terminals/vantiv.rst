Connecting a Vantiv payment terminal allows you to offer a fluid payment flow to your customers and
ease the work of your cashiers.

.. note::
   Please note MercuryPay only operates with US and Canadian banks, making this procedure only
   suitable for North American businesses.

.. warning::
   Vantiv card readers should be purchased exclusively from Vantiv, as certain Vantiv terminals
   bought on Amazon do not include the correct encryption needed to be used with an Odoo database.
