.. _reporting/executive-summary:

Executive Summary
-----------------

The **Executive Summary** allows a quick look at all the important figures to run your company.

In basic terms, this is what each item in the following section reports:

- **Performance:**
    - **Gross profit margin:**
        The contribution of all sales made by your business **minus** any direct costs needed to
        make those sales (labor, materials, etc.).
    - **Net profit margin:**
        The contribution of all sales made by your business **minus** any direct costs needed to
        make those sales *and* fixed overheads your company has (electricity, rent, taxes
        to be paid as a result of those sales, etc.).
    - **Return on investment (per annum):**
        The ratio of net profit made to the amount of assets the company used to make those profits.
- **Position:**
    - **Average debtors days:**
        The average number of days it takes your customers to (fully) pay you across all your
        customer invoices.
    - **Average creditors days:**
        The average number of days it takes you to (fully) pay your suppliers across all your bills.
    - **Short-term cash forecast:**
        How much cash is expected in or out of your business in the next month, i.e., the balance of
        your **Sales account** for the month **minus** the balance of your **Purchases account** for
        the month.
    - **Current assets to liabilities:**
        Also referred to as **current ratio**, this is the ratio of current assets (:dfn:`assets
        that could be turned into cash within a year`) to the current liabilities (:dfn:`liabilities
        that will be due in the next year`). It is typically used to measure a company's ability to
        service its debt.
