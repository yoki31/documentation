Expenses
========

Odoo **Expenses** streamlines the management of expenses.  After an employee submits their expenses
in Odoo, the expenses are reviewed by management and accounting teams. Once approved, payments can
then be processed and disbursed back to the employee for reimbursement(s).

   `Odoo Expenses: product page <https://www.odoo.com/app/expenses>`_

Set expense types
=================

The first step to track expenses is to configure the different *expense types* for the company
(managed as *products* in Odoo). Each "product" can be as specific or generalized as needed. Go to
:menuselection:`Expenses app --> Configuration --> Expense Products` to view the current expensable
products in a default kanban view.

.. image:: expenses/products.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Set expense costs on products.

To create a new expense product, click :guilabel:`Create`. A product form will appear. Only the
:guilabel:`Product Name` and :guilabel:`Unit of Measure` fields are required to create a new expense
product. Enter the :guilabel:`Product Name` in the field, and select the :guilabel:`Unit of Measure`
from the drop-down menu (most products will be set to :guilabel:`Units`, which is the default
selection).

.. tip::
   The *Sales* app is where specification on the units of measure are created and edited (e.g.
   units, miles, nights, etc.). Go to :menuselection:`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings` and
   ensure `Units of Measure` is enabled in the `Product Catalog` section. Click on the
   :guilabel:`Units of Measure` internal link to view, create, and edit the units of measure. Refer
   to :doc:`this document </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/management/products/uom>` to
   learn more about units of measure and how to configure them.

.. image:: expenses/new-expense-product.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Set expense costs on products.

The :guilabel:`Cost` field on the product form is populated with a value of `0.00` by default. When
a specific expense should always be reimbursed for a particular price, enter that amount in the
:guilabel:`Cost` field. Otherwise, leave the :guilabel:`Cost` set to `0.00`, and employees will
report the actual cost when submitting an expense report.

.. example::
   Here are some examples for when to set a specific :guilabel:`Cost` on a product vs. leaving the
   :guilabel:`Cost` at `0.00`:

   - **Meals**: Set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `0.00`. When an employee logs an expense for a meal,
     they enter the actual amount of the bill and will be reimbursed for that amount. An expense for
     a meal costing $95.23 would equal a reimbursement for $95.23.
   - **Mileage**: Set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `0.30`. When an employee logs an expense for
     "mileage", they enter the number of miles driven, and are reimbursed 0.30 per mile they
     entered. An expense for 100 miles would equal a reimbursement for $30.00.
   - **Monthly Parking**: Set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `75.00`. When an employee logs an expense for
     "monthly parking", the reimbursement would be for $75.00.
   - **Expenses**: Set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `0.00`. When an employee logs an expense that is not
     a meal, mileage, or monthly parking, they use the generic :guilabel:`Expenses` product. An
     expense for a laptop costing $350.00 would be logged as an :guilabel:`Expenses` product, and
     the reimbursement would be for $350.00.

Select an :guilabel:`Expense Account` if using the Odoo *Accounting* app. It is recommended to check
with the accounting department to determine the correct account to reference in this field as it
will affect reports.

Set a tax on each product in the :guilabel:`Vendor Taxes` and :guilabel:`Customer Taxes` fields if
applicable. It is considered good practice to use a tax that is configured with :ref:`Tax Included
in Price <taxes/included-in-price>`. Taxes will be automatically configured if this is set.

.. _expenses/new:

Record expenses
===============

Manually create a new expense
-----------------------------

To record a new expense, begin in the main :menuselection:`Expenses` app dashboard, which presents
the default :guilabel:`My Expenses to Report` view. This view can also be accessed from
:menuselection:`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Expenses to Report`.

First, click :guilabel:`Create`, and then fill out the various fields on the form.

- :guilabel:`Description`: Enter a short description for the expense in the :guilabel:`Description`
  field. This should be short and informative, such as `lunch with client` or `hotel for
  conference`.
- :guilabel:`Product`: Select the product from the drop-down menu that most closely corresponds to
  the expense. For example, an airplane ticket would be appropriate for an expense
  :guilabel:`Product` named :guilabel:`Air Travel`.
- :guilabel:`Total`: Enter the total amount paid for the expense in one of two ways:

  #. If the expense is for one single item/expense with a variable price, enter the cost in the
     :guilabel:`Total` field. Odoo will not display the :guilabel:`Quantity` field for a product if
     it does not need to have the quantity specified (a product with a unit price of `0.00` and a
     quantity of `1.00`).

  #. If the expense is for multiples of the same item/expense with a fixed price, the
     :guilabel:`Unit Price` is displayed. Enter the quantity in the :guilabel:`Quantity` field, and
     the :guilabel:`Total` is automatically updated with the correct total (the :guilabel:`Quantity`
     x the :guilabel:`Unit Price` = the :guilabel:`Total`).

     .. example::
        For example, in the case of mileage driven, the :guilabel:`Unit Price` would be set in the
        product form as the cost *per mile*. Simply set the :guilabel:`Quantity` to the *number of
        miles* driven, and the total for the expense is updated.

- :guilabel:`Bill Reference`: If there is any reference text that should be included for the
  expense, enter it in this field. This field is not visible for expense products that require a
  :guilabel:`Quantity` to be entered.
- :guilabel:`Expense Date`: Using the calendar module, enter the date the expense was incurred. Use
  the :guilabel:`< (left)` and :guilabel:`> (right)` arrows to navigate to the correct month, then
  click on the specific day to enter the selection.
- :guilabel:`Account`: Select the expense account that this expense should be logged on from the
  drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice`: If the expense is something that should be paid for by a
  customer, select the customer and related sales order that will be invoiced for this expense from
  the drop-down menu. For example, if a customer wishes to have a custom designed piece of
  furniture, and purchased design hours from our employee, that sales order listing the hours would
  be referenced as the :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice`. In the list view, there may be many
  different sales orders referencing the same company, so be sure the correct sales order is
  selected.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice` field is only visible if the expense product has either
   :guilabel:`At cost` or :guilabel:`Sales price` selected under the :guilabel:`Re-Invoice Expenses`
   section. If :guilabel:`No` is selected for the :guilabel:`Re-Invoice Expenses` section, the
   :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice` field is hidden.

- :guilabel:`Analytic Account`: Select the account the expense should be written against from the
  drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Company`: If multiple companies are set-up, select the company this expense should be
  filed for from the drop-down menu. If there is only one company, this field will be automatically
  populated.
- :guilabel:`Employee`: Using the drop-down menu, select the employee this expense is for.
- :guilabel:`Paid By`: Click the radio button to indicate who paid for the expense and should be
  reimbursed. If the employee paid for the expense (and should be reimbursed) select
  :guilabel:`Employee (to reimburse)`. If the company paid directly instead (e.g. if the company
  credit card was used to pay for the expense) select :guilabel:`Company`.
- :guilabel:`Notes...`: If any notes are needed in order to clarify the expense, enter them in the
  notes field.

Once all the fields have been filled out, click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. image:: expenses/expense-filled-in.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A filled in expense form for a client lunch.

Attach a receipt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the expense is saved, the next step is to attach a receipt. A new :guilabel:`Attach Receipt`
button appears after the entry is saved, beneath the former :guilabel:`Save` button (which turns
into an :guilabel:`Edit` button).

.. image:: expenses/save-receipt.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Attach a receipt after saving the record.

Click the new :guilabel:`Attach Receipt` button, and a file explorer appears. Navigate to the
receipt to be attached, and click :guilabel:`Open`. The new receipt is recorded in the chatter, and
the number of receipts will appear next to the :guilabel:`ðŸ“Ž(paperclip)` icon beneath the expense
form. More than one receipt can be attached to an individual expense, as needed. The number of
receipts attached to the expense will be noted on the paperclip icon.

.. image:: expenses/receipt-icon.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View receipts in the chatter and see how many receipts are attached byu looking at the
         paperclip icon in the chatter beneath the record.

Create new expenses from a scanned receipt
------------------------------------------

Rather than manually inputting all of the information for an expense, expenses can be created
automatically by scanning a PDF receipt.

First, in the main :guilabel:`Expenses` app dashboard view (this view can also be accessed from
:menuselection:`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Expenses to Report`), click :guilabel:`Scan`,
and a file explorer pops up. Navigate to the receipt to be uploaded, click on it to select it, and
then click :guilabel:`Open`.

.. image:: expenses/scan.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Create an expense by scanning a receipt. Click Scan at the top of the Expenses dashboard
         view.

The receipt is scanned, and a new entry is created with today's date as the :guilabel:`Expense
Date`, and any other fields it can populate based on the scanned data, such as the total. Click on
the new entry to open the individual expense form, and click :guilabel:`Edit` to make changes. The
receipt that was scanned in appears in the chatter. Make any edits to the form, then click
:guilabel:`Save` when all the information is entered.

Automatically create new expenses from an email
-----------------------------------------------

Instead of individually creating each expense in the *Expenses* app, expenses can be automatically
created by sending an email to an email alias.

To do so, first, an email alias needs to be configured. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Settings`. Ensure :guilabel:`Incoming Emails` is enabled.

.. image:: expenses/email-alias.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Create the domain alias by clicking the link.

.. note::
   If the domain alias needs to be set up, :guilabel:`Setup your domain alias` will appear beneath
   the incoming emails check box instead of the email address field. Refer to this documentation for
   setup instructions and more information:
   :doc:`/applications/websites/website/configuration/domain_names`. Once the domain alias is
   configured, the email address field will be visible beneath the incoming emails section.

Next, enter the email address to be used in the email field, then click :guilabel:`Save`. Now that
the email address has been entered, emails can be sent to that alias to create new expenses without
having to be in the Odoo database.

To submit an expense via email, create a new email and enter the product's *internal reference* code
(if available) and the amount of the expense in the email subject. Next, attach the receipt to the
email. Odoo creates the expense by taking the information in the email subject and combining it with
the receipt.

To check an expense product's internal reference, go to :menuselection:`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Expense Products`. If an internal reference is listed on the product, it is
visible in this view.

.. image:: expenses/internal-reference.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Internal reference numbers are listed in the main Expense Products view.

To add an internal reference on an expense product, click on the product, then click
:guilabel:`Edit`. In edit mode, enter the :guilabel:`Internal Reference` in the field. Beneath the
:guilabel:`Internal Reference` field, this sentence appears: :guilabel:`Use this reference as a
subject prefix when submitting by email.`.

.. image:: expenses/accomodation-internal-reference.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Internal reference numbers are listed in the main Expense Products view.

.. note::
   For security purposes, only authenticated employee emails are accepted by Odoo when creating an
   expense from an email. To confirm an authenticated employee email address, go to the employee
   card in the :guilabel:`Employees` app, and refer to the :guilabel:`Work Email` in the main field.

   .. image:: expenses/authenticated-email-address.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Create the domain alias by clicking the link.

.. example::
   If submitting an expense via email for a $25.00 meal during a work trip, the email subject would
   be `Ref005 Meal $25.00`.

   Explanation:

   - The :guilabel:`Internal Reference` for the expense product `Meals` is `Ref005`
   - The :guilabel:`Cost` for the expense is `$25.00`

.. _expenses/report:

Create an expense report
========================

When expenses are ready to submit (such as at the end of a business trip, or once a month), an
*expense report* needs to be created. Go to the main :menuselection:`Expenses` app dashboard, which
displays a default :guilabel:`My Expenses` view, or go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> My
Expenses --> My Expenses to Report`.

First, each individual expense for the report must be selected by clicking the check box next to
each entry, or quickly select all the expenses in the list by clicking the check box next to
:guilabel:`Expense Date`.

.. image:: expenses/create-report.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Select the expenses to submit, then create the report.

Once the expenses have been selected, click the :guilabel:`Create Report` button. The new report
appears with all the expenses listed, and the :guilabel:`Employee`, :guilabel:`Paid By`,
:guilabel:`Expense Journal`, and :guilabel:`Company` fields are automatically populated from the
individual expenses in the report.

It is recommended to add a short summary for each report to help keep expenses organized. Enter a
short description for the expense report (such as `Client Trip NYC`, or `Repairs for Company Car`)
in the :guilabel:`Expense Report Summary` field.

.. note::
   If all the expenses are listed for the same date, the :guilabel:`Expense Report Summary`
   field will be pre-populated with the date for the expenses.

Next, select a :guilabel:`Manager` from the drop-down menu to assign a manager to review the report.

.. image:: expenses/expense-report-summary.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Enter a short description and select a manager for the report.

If some expenses are not on the report that should be, they can still be added. Click :guilabel:`Add
a line` at the bottom of the :guilabel:`Expense` tab. Click the check box next to each expense to
add, then click :guilabel:`Select`. The items now appear on the report that was just created.

.. image:: expenses/add-an-expense-line.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Add more expenses to the report before submitting.

When all edits have been completed, click :guilabel:`Save`. Once the expense report is saved, an
:guilabel:`Expenses` smart button appears in the top-right corner, listing the number of expenses on
the report. Click the :guilabel:`Expenses` smart button to view the individual expenses for the
report in a list.

.. image:: expenses/expense-smart-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: An Expenses smart button appears after saving the expense report.

.. _expenses/submit:

Submit an expense report
------------------------

When an expense report is completed, the next step is to submit the report to a manager for
approval. Reports must be individually submitted, and cannot be submitted in batches. Open the
specific report from the list of expense reports (if the report is not already open). To view all
expense reports, go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Reports`.

If the list is large, grouping the results by status may be helpful since only reports that are in a
:guilabel:`Draft` mode need to be submitted, reports with an :guilabel:`Approved` or
:guilabel:`Submitted` status do not.

.. image:: expenses/expense-status.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Submit the report to the manager.

.. note::
   The status of each report is shown in the :guilabel:`Status` column on the far right. If the
   :guilabel:`Status` column is not visible, click the :guilabel:`â‹® (additional options)` icon at
   the end of the row, and check the box next to :guilabel:`Status`.

Click on a report to open it, then click :guilabel:`Submit To Manager`. After submitting a report,
the next step is to wait for the manager to approve it.

.. important::
   The :ref:`expenses/approve`, :ref:`expenses/post`, and :ref:`expenses/reimburse` sections are
   **only** for users with the *necessary rights*.

.. _expenses/approve:

Approve expenses
================

In Odoo, not just anyone can approve expense reportsâ€” only users with the necessary rights (or
permissions) can. This means that a user must have at least *Team Approver* rights for the
*Expenses* app. Employees with the necessary rights can review expense reports, and approve or
reject them, as well as provide feedback thanks to the integrated communication tool.

To see who has rights to approve, go to the main :menuselection:`Settings` app and click on
:guilabel:`Manage Users`.

.. note::
   If the *Settings* app is not available, then certain rights are not set on the account. In the
   :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab of a user's card in the :menuselection:`Settings` app, the
   :guilabel:`Administration` section is set to one of three options:

   - :guilabel:`None (blank)`: The user cannot access the *Settings* app at all.
   - :guilabel:`Access Rights`: The user can only view the :guilabel:`User's & Companies` section of
     the *Settings* app.
   - :guilabel:`Settings`: The user has access to the entire *Settings* app with no restrictions.

   Please refer to :doc:`this document </applications/general/users>` to learn more about managing
   users and their access rights.

Click on an individual to view their card, which displays the :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab in the
default view. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Human Resources` section. Under :guilabel:`Expenses`,
there are four options:

- :guilabel:`None (blank)`: A blank field means the user has no rights to view or approve expense
  reports, and can only view their own.
- :guilabel:`Team Approver`: The user can only view and approve expense reports for their own
  specific team.
- :guilabel:`All Approver`: The user can view and approve any expense report.
- :guilabel:`Administrator`: The user can view and approve any expense report as well as access the
  reporting and configuration menus in the *Expenses* app.

Users who are able to approve expense reports (typically managers) can easily view all expense
reports to validate. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> Expense Reports  --> Reports to
Approve`. This view lists all the expense reports that have been submitted but not approved, as
noted by the :guilabel:`Submitted` tag in the status column.

.. image:: expenses/reports-to-approve.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Reports to validate are found on the Reports to Approve page.

Reports can be approved in two ways (individually or several at once) and refused only one way. To
approve multiple expense reports at once, remain in the list view. First, select the reports to
approve by clicking the check box next to each report, or click the box next to :guilabel:`Employee`
to select all reports in the list. Next, click the :guilabel:`Approve Report` button. The number of
reports that are selected appear next to the  :guilabel:`Approve Report` button, in an :guilabel:`X
Selected` button, with X being the number of reports currently selected.

.. image:: expenses/approve-report.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Approve multiple reports by clicking the checkboxes next to each report.

To approve an individual report, click on a report to go to a detailed view of that report. In this
view, several options are presented: :guilabel:`Approve`, :guilabel:`Refuse`, or :guilabel:`Reset to
draft`. Click :guilabel:`Approve` to approve the report.

If :guilabel:`Refuse` is clicked, a pop-up window appears. Enter a brief explanation for the refusal
in the :guilabel:`Reason to refuse Expense` field, then click :guilabel:`Refuse`.

.. image:: expenses/refuse-expense.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Send messages in the chatter.

Team managers can easily view all the expense reports to approve for their team members. While in
the :guilabel:`Reports to Approve` view, click on :guilabel:`Filters`, then click :guilabel:`My
Team`. This presents all the reports to approve for the manager's team. Manager's can easily view
*all* reports for their team by simply clicking on and removing the :guilabel:`To Approve` filter in
the :guilabel:`Search...` bar, leaving only the :guilabel:`My Team` filter active.

.. image:: expenses/my-team-filter.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Select the My Team filter.

.. tip::
   If more information is needed, such as a missing receipt, communication is easy from the chatter.
   In an individual report, simply click :guilabel:`Send Message`, then type in a message in the
   text box that appears, tagging the proper person (if  needed), and post it to the chatter by
   clicking :guilabel:`Send`. The message is posted in the chatter, and the person tagged will be
   notified via email of the message, as well as anyone following.

   Note that only followers can be tagged in a message. To tag someone who is not following, add
   them as a follower first. Click the :guilabel:`ðŸ‘¤ (person)` icon, then click :guilabel:`Add
   Followers`, then enter their name in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, and finally, click
   :guilabel:`Add Followers`.

   .. image:: expenses/chatter.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Send messages in the chatter.

.. _expenses/post:

Post expenses in accounting
===========================

Once an expense report is approved, the next step is to post the report to the accounting journal.
To view all expense reports to post, go to :menuselection:`Expenses --> Expense Reports --> Reports
To Post`.

.. image:: expenses/post-reports.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View reports to post by clicking on expense reports, then reports to post.

Just like approvals, expense reports can be posted in two ways (individually or several at once). To
post multiple expense reports at once, remain in the list view. First, select the reports to post by
clicking the check box next to each report, or click the box next to :guilabel:`Employee` to select
all reports in the list. Next, click :guilabel:`Post Entries`.

.. image:: expenses/post-entries.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Post multiple reports from the Post Entries view.

To post an individual report, click on a report to go to the detailed view of that report. In this
view, several options are presented: :guilabel:`Post Journal Entries`, :guilabel:`Report In Next
Payslip`, :guilabel:`Refuse`, or :guilabel:`Reset to Draft`. Click :guilabel:`Post Journal Entries`
to post the report.

If :guilabel:`Refuse` is clicked, a pop-up window appears. Enter a brief explanation for the refusal
in the :guilabel:`Reason to refuse Expense` field, then click :guilabel:`Refuse`. Refused reports
can be viewed by going to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> Expense Reports  --> All Reports`. This
list shows all reports, including the refused ones.

.. note::
   To post expense reports to an accounting journal, the user must have following access rights:

   - Accounting: Accountant or Adviser
   - Expenses: Manager

.. _expenses/reimburse:

Reimburse employees
===================

After an expense report is posted to an accounting journal, the next step is to reimburse the
employee. To view all expense reports to pay, go to :menuselection:`Expenses --> Expense Reports -->
Reports To Pay`.

.. image:: expenses/reports-to-pay.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View reports to pay by clicking on expense reports, then reports to pay.

Just like approvals and posting, expense reports can be paid in two ways (individually or several at
once). To pay multiple expense reports at once, remain in the list view. First, select the reports
to pay by clicking the check box next to each report, or click the box next to :guilabel:`Employee`
to select all reports in the list. Next, click :guilabel:`Register Payment`.

.. image:: expenses/register-payment.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Post multiple reports by clicking the checkboxes, clicking the gear, then post the entries.

To pay an individual report, click on a report to go to a detailed view of that report. Click
:guilabel:`Register Payment` to pay the employee.

Re-invoice expenses to customers
================================

If an expense is to be reimbursed by a customer and not the company, the expense can be
automatically charged to the customer. This is done by first referencing the :abbr:`SO (Sales
Order)` the expense should be applied to when creating the expense.

The next steps are the same as if the expense is being reimbursed by the company instead of a
customer. The expense or expenses are placed on an expense report, and then the expense report is
submitted for approval. Next, managers approve the expense report, and the accounting department
post the journal entry.

Finally, once the expense report is posted to a journal, the expense then appears on the :abbr:`SO
(Sales Order)` that was referenced when the expense was first created.

The sales order can then be invoiced, thus invoicing the customer for the expense.

Setup
-----

First, specify the invoicing policy for each expense product. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Expense Products`. Click on the expense product to edit, then click
:guilabel:`Edit`. Under the :guilabel:`Invoicing` section, select the :guilabel:`Invoicing Policy`
and :guilabel:`Re-Invoicing Policy` by clicking the radio button next to the desired selection.

:guilabel:`Invoicing Policy`:

- :guilabel:`Ordered quantities`: Expense product will only invoice expenses based on the ordered
  quantity.
- :guilabel:`Delivered quantities`: Expense product will only invoice expenses based on the
  delivered quantity.

:guilabel:`Re-Invoicing Policy`:

- :guilabel:`No`: Expense product will not be re-invoiced.
- :guilabel:`At cost`: Expense product will invoice expenses at their real cost.
- :guilabel:`At sales price`: Expense product will invoice the price set on the sale order.

Create an expense and expense report
------------------------------------

First, when :ref:`creating a new expense <expenses/new>`, the correct information needs to be
entered in order to re-invoice a customer. Using the drop-down menu, select the *sales order* the
expense will appear on in the :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice` section. Next, select the
:guilabel:`Analytic Account` the expense will be posted to. After the expense(s) is created, the
expense report needs to be :ref:`created <expenses/report>` and :ref:`submitted <expenses/submit>`
as usual.

.. image:: expenses/reinvoice-expense.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Ensure the customer to be invoiced is called out on the expense.

.. important::
   Selecting a :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice` when creating an expense is critical, since this
   field is unable to be modified once the expense is added to an expense report.

Validate and post expenses
--------------------------

Only employees with permissions (typically managers or supervisors) can :ref:`approve expenses
<expenses/approve>`. Before approving an expense report, ensure the :guilabel:`Analytic Account` is
set on every expense line of a report. If an :guilabel:`Analytic Account` is missing, click
:guilabel:`Edit` and select the correct account from the drop-down menu, then click
:guilabel:`Approve` or :guilabel:`Refuse`.

The accounting department is typically responsible for :ref:`posting journal entries
<expenses/post>`. Once an expense report is approved, it can then be posted. The :abbr:`SO (Sales
Order)` is **only** updated *after the journal entry is posted*, and the expense(s) now appear on
the referenced :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)`.

Invoice expenses
----------------

Once the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` has been updated, it is time to invoice the customer. After the
expense report has been approved and the journal entry has been posted, the :abbr:`SO (Sales
Order)` can be opened and the expenses can be seen on it. Click anywhere on an expense line, and the
details for that individual expense appears in a pop-up. Click on the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` that
is listed next to :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice`.

.. image:: expenses/sales-order.png
   :align: center
   :alt: After the expense report is posted to the journal entry, the sales order can be called up
         by clicking on the sales order number.

The :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` appears, and now the expenses are listed in the :guilabel:`Order Lines`
tab.

.. image:: expenses/so-details.png
   :align: center
   :alt: See the expenses listed on the sales order after clicking into it.

Next, click :guilabel:`Create Invoice`, and select if the invoice is for a :guilabel:`Regular
invoice`, a :guilabel:`Down payment (percentage)`, or a :guilabel:`Down payment (fixed amount)` by
clicking the radio button next to it. Then, click :guilabel:`Create Invoice`. The customer has now
been invoiced for the expenses.
