VoIP widget
===========

The *VoIP* widget is an add-on made available to Odoo users through the *VoIP* module. It is used to
incorporate virtual telephony into the database. The widget is the control center for making and
managing calls in Odoo.

Phone calls
===========

To make phone calls while in the Odoo database, click the :guilabel:`üìû (phone)` icon, located in
the top navigation bar.

When clicked, a :guilabel:`VOIP` pop-up widget appears in the lower-left corner of the Odoo
database. The widget allows users to freely navigate throughout the database, while making and
receiving calls.

When receiving calls in Odoo, the :guilabel:`VOIP` widget rings,and displays a notification. To
close the widget, click the :guilabel:`X (close)` icon in the upper-right of the widget's screen.

.. note::
   The :abbr:`VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)` number is the one provided by Axivox. It can be
   accessed by navigating to `https://manage.axivox.com/ <https://manage.axivox.com/>`_. After
   logging into the portal, go to :menuselection:`Users --> Outgoing number` (column).

.. tip::
   If an *Incorrect Number* error message appears in the Odoo *VoIP* widget, make sure to use the
   international format, leading with the :guilabel:`+ (plus)` sign, followed by the international
   country code.

   (E.g., +16506913277, where `+1` is the international prefix for the United States.)
